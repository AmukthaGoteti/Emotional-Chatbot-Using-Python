# Emotional Chatbot Using Python

In India, where mental health care can be costly and limited, **emotional support chatbots** offer a practical, affordable, and accessible solution.  
This project demonstrates how a Python-based chatbot can use **regular expressions** to understand user input and provide empathetic, relevant responses — bridging the gap in mental health resources.

---

## 📚 About the Project
This chatbot is designed to:
- Engage users in supportive conversations.
- Provide predefined, empathetic responses based on detected input patterns.
- Allow users to start and end a conversation easily (type `goodbye` to exit).

By using **pattern matching** through Python’s `re` module, it analyses messages and responds in a way that feels personal and emotionally supportive.

---

## 🛠 Features
- 💬 **Text-based interaction** — Simply type and chat in the terminal.
- 🧠 **Pattern recognition** — Matches user input to emotional triggers using regex.
- ❤️ **Empathetic responses** — Tailored to provide emotional comfort.
- 🚪 **Easy exit** — End the conversation by typing `goodbye`.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries required (uses built-in Python modules).

## 🚀 Installation & Usage

## 🗂 How It Works

1. The chatbot uses **regular expressions** to detect keywords or patterns in user messages.
2. Each pattern has a **predefined response** stored in a dictionary or list.
3. When a match is found, the chatbot replies with the corresponding supportive message.
4. If no match is found, it gives a default empathetic response.
